# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Bug

This repository demonstrates a common issue where Tailwind CSS classes seem to not be applied correctly to HTML elements. The problem lies in ensuring that Tailwind's build process is integrated correctly into your project and that your CSS is correctly linked or imported into the project.

## Bug Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the development server.
3. Observe that the background color and other styles defined using Tailwind CSS classes are not being applied correctly to the HTML element.

## Solution

The solution involves ensuring that the build process correctly generates CSS file(s) from your Tailwind directives and that this output file(s) are correctly imported into or linked to your HTML file.  Ensure that your Tailwind configuration and build steps are set up properly. This usually involves installing the necessary packages and following the configuration steps outlined in Tailwind CSS documentation.
